What this .zip contains

In this folder you should see:

- 1 image of what the scene should look like when you open the blender file
- 1 folder with 19 .fbx files of the individual items

I have only hosted it on madebyjawns.itch.io, so if you downloaded it from somewhere else, please be careful and check it's legit.

Looking forward to see what you can make. Make sure to add a comment on the itch page with a link to any of your projects that are using this pack, would love to see your work!
